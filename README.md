# Dotfiles

Various settings for the tools I use. My dotfile repository was initially created by a combination of following Victoria's excellent [How to set up a fresh Ubuntu Desktop using only dotfiles and bash scripts] and structured to match Holman's dotfiles ([Github - Holman's Dotfiles]).

## Setup

### Linux - Debian

To set up a new Debian based Linux system, do the following initial steps upon logging in:

```sh
# Downloads and install xclip BEFORE running any updates
$ sudo apt-get install xclip

# Run Updates
$ sudo apt update -y && sudo apt upgrade -y

# Navigate to GitHub and log in -> Settings -> SSH & GPG Keys -> New SSH Key

# Generate new SSH Key
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"

# Add newly created SSH key to GitHub account

# Use xclip to copy content of public key so you can paste it in GitHub
$ xclip -sel clip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
# Copies the contents of the id_rsa.pub file to your clipboard

# Clone dotfiles
$ git clone git@github.com:johannesgiorgis/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles

# Run ansible playbook
$ cd ~/.dotfiles
$ bash bin/dot-bootstrap <tag>
```

Doing it this way ensures that you can run your updates while you get set up to clone the repo and start the rest of the set up.

## Testing

Run the following:

```sh
# build docker image and run docker container
$ make docker-all

# once in the docker container, run
$ bash scripts/bootstrap.sh | tee setup_log.log

# another testing
$ bash scripts/bootstrap.sh | tee log-2020-05-10-bootstrap-v<num>.log 2>&1
```

## Dotfiles V2

= [to-do list](docs/todo.md)

This is currently a wishlist.

As I continue to customize the various scripts, I wanted more control over certain functionality - let user choose which custom program to install, not install, etc. Yet I don't want to write and go throught the trial and error of bash scripting.

This led me to research how to manage dotfiles and found several options - ansible, dotstow. I came across several articles:

- <https://medium.com/espinola-designs/manage-your-dotfiles-with-ansible-6dbedd5532bb>
- <https://github.com/sloria/dotfiles>
- <https://github.com/elnappo/dotfiles>
- <https://dev.to/alexdesousa/managing-dotfiles-with-ansible-3kbg>
- <https://github.com/alexdesousa/dotfiles>
- <https://medium.com/@codejamninja/dotstow-the-smart-way-to-manage-your-dotfiles-8a0a8b6d984c>

Folks are using Python, Typescript to write wrapper programs around their .dotfiles management. Maybe some combination of bash + ansible could work.

**Current**: Migrating to Ansible

### Issues

I was unable to install my desired theeme `powerlevel10k` via antigen. I kept getting the following error:

```sh
âžœ antigen theme https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k powerlevel10k
(anon):source:27: no such file or directory: /home/johannes/.antigen/internal/p10k.zsh
```

So I decided to use Oh-My-Zsh to manage my theme only to find out the theme wouldn't load.

Googling around led me to this github issue thread <https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k/issues/825> where the theme author himself says he doesn't use a plugin manager himself. Also it seems antigen hasn't been updated in a while. Since I had everything working perfectly via using Oh-My-Zsh, I'll set up Ansible to do just that.

### Unexpected Test

On September 10th, I accidentally messed up my initial installation of Pop_OS! via trying to install some Virtual Machine related installations the Pop!_Shop prompted me with. Re-installing from the ISO image I originally used, there were too many updates so I grabbed a more recent ISO image from their website.

Re-installing Pop_OS! was an unexpected test to see how my Ansible work was coming along. I was back to being productive on VS Code and adding more cool stuff before long. It's awesome!
