# Github Actions Learnings

The biggest learning/change was the renaming of my repo to `.dotfiles`.

Why? Because I cloned my `dotfiles` repo to a local directory called `.dotfiles` and all scripts were set up to run under the `.dotfiles/` directory. This caused issues as Github Action runners checked out the `dotfiles` repo and that's where the scripts were called from.

Googling around led me to this [issue](https://github.com/actions/checkout/issues/197#) (open as of Sep 2023) and this [issue comment](https://github.com/actions/checkout/issues/197#issuecomment-829560171) where someone successfully renamed their repo by copying it over.

After some trial and error, the easiest solution was simply to rename my repo to from `dotfiles` to `.dotfiles`. This would make it consistent everywhere else and simplify my adoption of Github Actions. Github Action runners would check out the same directory and scripts would run with no issues ðŸŽ‰ A simple fix to a silly solution.

Second learning was something I came across was from the below article on using Github Actions for continuous integration of MacOS based dotfiles. Specifically, the use of environment variables and determining where you were running.
