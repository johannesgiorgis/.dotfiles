# Github Actions Learnings

## Repo Renaming

The biggest learning/change was the renaming of my repo to `.dotfiles`.

Why? Because I cloned my `dotfiles` repo to a local directory called `.dotfiles` and all scripts were set up to run under the `.dotfiles/` directory. This caused issues as Github Action runners checked out the `dotfiles` repo and that's where the scripts were called from.

Googling around led me to this [issue](https://github.com/actions/checkout/issues/197#) (open as of Sep 2023) and this [issue comment](https://github.com/actions/checkout/issues/197#issuecomment-829560171) where someone successfully renamed their repo by copying it over.

After some trial and error, the easiest solution was simply to rename my repo to from `dotfiles` to `.dotfiles`. This would make it consistent everywhere else and simplify my adoption of Github Actions. Github Action runners would check out the same directory and scripts would run with no issues ðŸŽ‰ A simple fix to a silly solution.

Second learning was something I came across was from the below article on using Github Actions for continuous integration of MacOS based dotfiles. Specifically, the use of environment variables and determining where you were running.

## Ansible Current Workig Directory for Symlinks

What was I solving? I had the idea of installing zsh via my `zsh` role and running `source zsh` as part of my Github Action test workflow to verify everything works as expected for both MacOS and Linux systems. My current setup simply installed the `timewarrior` package and verified its presence via `command -v timew`.

I hit an issue where the symlinking of files were hardcoded to expect $HOME/.dotfiles/files/<file-to-symlink>. Running within Github CI systems would lead to this path/file not existing.

How to solve it? I needed ansible to inform me of my current working directory. Quick Google search led to Ansible special variables - `playbook_dir`:

> The path to the directory of the current playbook being executed. NOTE: This might be different than directory of the playbook passed to the ansible-playbook command line when a playbook contains a import_playbook statement.

So my old symlink commands:

```yml
- name: ZSH - Symlink zsh/ to $HOME/zsh/
  file:
    src: "{{ dotfiles_home }}/files/zsh"
    dest: "{{ dotfiles_user_home }}/zsh"
    state: link
```

became

```yml
- name: ZSH - Symlink zsh/ to $HOME/zsh/
  file:
    src: "{{ playbook_dir }}/files/zsh"
    dest: "{{ dotfiles_user_home }}/zsh"
    state: link
```

A one variable switcheroo and I had it working ðŸŽ‰
